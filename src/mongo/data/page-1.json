We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/culture-at-coinbase-f0e1c2a99aff\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;culture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;mission-focused approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt; to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;You’re never tired of learning.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes.

We’re looking for a mid-level content designer (content strategist, UX writer) who shares our passion to revolutionize credit — and have fun doing it — to join our small but mighty team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The content designer in this role will work on high-priority projects as an embedded partner of a product team.

Since most financial institutions rely on traditional credit scoring to assess risk, that means these people can't access affordable financial products. Instead, they resort to high-interest credit cards, payday loans, and trigger overdraft fees to make ends meet — which ultimately push them into deeper cycles of debt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pinwheel provides an API platform that makes it easy to connect payroll accounts like ADP and Gusto to any app. By unlocking the wealth of identity, income, and employment data that sits in these systems, alongside direct access to paychecks, we can help innovators build the next generation of financial products that increase access for the underserved while improving the businesses of our partner fintechs, banks, and lenders.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are we looking for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a B2B marketer, you have a customer-centric approach, are data driven, and have a love for crafting multidimensional customer experiences from content to events. The ideal candidate will be passionate about business selling, have a strong understanding of b2b marketing best practices, be an experienced copywriter, and have a bias for action while we test and learn into a scalable GTM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you be doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Marketing Associate, you will play a critical role in driving growth for Pinwheel.

Be a powerful storyteller with customer empathy, motivations, and pain points.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Activate our corporate story on social, with content partners, and together with our PR agency&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evaluate, negotiate, and manage partners for sponsorships, event activations, client entertainment, and gifting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with sales on Account Based Marketing, ensuring full visibility and alignment with sales pipeline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner closely with Pinwheel HR on Employer Brand and employee activations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage annual marketing plan and budget, reporting periodically to our Executive Team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What experience, skills, and qualifications are necessary?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1-3 years of experience in a B2B marketing role - financial services or tech preferred&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Highly collaborative with experience partnering with sales and product organizations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor's Degree required, preferably in Marketing or English&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional communication skills; professional grade copywriter &amp;amp; proofreader&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of event marketing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience managing social platforms and content posted, especially on LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self starter comfortable working in a hybrid office environment if located in New York City&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why join Pinwheel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Time to Join&lt;/strong&gt; - We are small but well-funded, meaning you get the upside of starting on the bottom floor with minimal risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Cultural Founder&lt;/strong&gt; - You will have an active hand in molding our culture and being a part of the growth journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Something Revolutionary&lt;/strong&gt; - Help build the consumer data infrastructure of the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits included:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Great compensation &amp;amp; equity packages&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Full medical, dental, and vision benefits&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Life &amp;amp; short-term disability insurance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Unlimited vacation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Paid parental leave&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;401K for retirement planning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mentorship opportunities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free Citibike membership&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pet friendly offices and Zoom spaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Pinwheel, total compensation is made up of salary + equity + benefits.

Yes, sustenance is crucial, but it’s also much more than that. Food can be a part of a daily ritual or a special moment that resonates with people on a meaningful and emotional level. It provides a much-needed break in a long day, a taste that brings back memories, a creative experiment, a shared meal with loved ones, or even comfort during a hard time. Wether it’s a special occasion or an everyday occurrence, it should always be easy for people to get the ingredients they need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Instacart Product Team is dedicated to making grocery shopping effortless for everyone.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Axiom:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom is where legal teams go to find the right talent for everything from routine in-house tasks to complex outside counsel work. Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession. We love the company we’re building with undignified enthusiasm. We’re committed to our mission and to our people. We celebrate our successes, learn from our failures, and find opportunity in adversity. We surround ourselves with inspiring, talented people who have a contagious energy and incurable passion for what they do. We pride ourselves on listening and relating to our colleagues and clients in a way that’s genuine, human, and memorable. We care about the little things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate new, creative, and disruptive ideas to change the status quo in their fields&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess an unbelievable work ethic and unwavering commitment to quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stretch beyond what’s expected and prioritize ongoing learning and development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assume best intentions and take a ‘glass half full’ approach to their work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring others together, creating strong relationships across lines of difference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seek to understand and learn from perspectives counter to their own&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leave a lasting impression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are looking to hire salespeople to fuel our continued growth. With our backing and proven success, we’re looking for evangelists – salespeople who can envision a better future for clients, bring clients to see that vision, and create lasting partnerships that exceed clients’ greatest expectations. This role is well-suited for a highly consultative seller who’s accustomed to sitting at the table with executive-level decision makers to devise solutions to their toughest problems. You will be afforded a high degree of accountability and ownership over a portfolio of F500 and industry leading clients focusing on account growth as well as new business generation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifically, you will spend your days:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Originating opportunity and closing deals: You will be responsible for bringing in new business (new logo generation), originating and selling to our biggest fans, and making believers of fresh clients.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Getting to know your clients: You will define the client experience by building durable relationships, inspiring trust, and proposing innovative solutions to their problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consulting with C-level executives: Our clients are savvy leaders of the world’s largest in-house legal teams, and you will be at the table with them daily planning for their future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborating: At Axiom we pride ourselves on our cross-functional sales culture. This is a not a role for the lone wolf seller. You will partner daily with the broader commercial team to close and support strategic opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leading: You will offer thought leadership to clients as well as internally mentor and offer professional insights to junior team members.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a background in B2B client service and have extensive experience consultative sales role where you exceeded business goals on a monthly, quarterly, and/or annual basis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a proven track record in heavy business development initiatives and generating new logos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are comfortable working in a senior role as an individual contributor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You understand what goes into the sales process from prospecting to close, and you’re no stranger to managing multiple complex deals across multiple clients and stages.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are highly organized with a meticulous attention to detail and pattern recognition, you manage your time well and possess expert judgment and decision-making skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a high-impact communicator and know how to present to executive-level stakeholders. You’re no stranger to PowerPoint and the rest of Microsoft Office Suite.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You know your way around Salesforce (or comparable CRM system) and understand the importance of leveraging data to make smart decisions about where to spend your time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You demonstrate a relentless service orientation, effortlessly form trusted-advisor relationships, are catalytic in your desire to improve the status quo, and can operate effectively within a highly collaborative team environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are legally eligible to work in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom’s total rewards philosophy is to be transparent and equitable with all job candidates. The annual base salary range for this role based in New York City, New York is $90,000-$102,500. You will also be eligible to participate in our Quarterly Bonus Plan which on target would be 65% of your base salary for a Manager level role in our Commercial business unit. You can also participate in our benefits programs that include healthcare, life and disability coverage, 401K with company match, paid sick and personal time off, paid parental leave and more&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Please note that the final compensation is determined by several considerations, including the quality of your experience and expertise, your ability to immediately contribute to Axiom, your potential to move up to the next level, the market you are located in, and other business considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities: &lt;/strong&gt;Upon request and consistent with applicable laws, Axiom will attempt to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities who require an accommodation to participate in the application process.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Axiom:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom is where legal teams go to find the right talent for everything from routine in-house tasks to complex outside counsel work. Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession. We love the company we’re building with undignified enthusiasm. We’re committed to our mission and to our people. We celebrate our successes, learn from our failures, and find opportunity in adversity. We surround ourselves with inspiring, talented people who have a contagious energy and incurable passion for what they do. We pride ourselves on listening and relating to our colleagues and clients in a way that’s genuine, human, and memorable. We care about the little things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate new, creative, and disruptive ideas to change the status quo in their fields&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess an unbelievable work ethic and unwavering commitment to quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stretch beyond what’s expected and prioritize ongoing learning and development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assume best intentions and take a ‘glass half full’ approach to their work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring others together, creating strong relationships across lines of difference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seek to understand and learn from perspectives counter to their own&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leave a lasting impression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are looking to hire salespeople to fuel our continued growth. With our backing and proven success, we’re looking for evangelists – salespeople who can envision a better future for clients, bring clients to see that vision, and create lasting partnerships that exceed clients’ greatest expectations. This role is well-suited for a highly consultative seller who’s accustomed to sitting at the table with executive-level decision makers to devise solutions to their toughest problems. You will be afforded a high degree of accountability and ownership over a portfolio of F500 and industry leading clients focusing on account growth as well as new business generation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifically, you will spend your days:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Originating opportunity and closing deals: You will be responsible for bringing in new business (new logo generation), originating and selling to our biggest fans, and making believers of fresh clients.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Getting to know your clients: You will define the client experience by building durable relationships, inspiring trust, and proposing innovative solutions to their problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consulting with C-level executives: Our clients are savvy leaders of the world’s largest in-house legal teams, and you will be at the table with them daily planning for their future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborating: At Axiom we pride ourselves on our cross-functional sales culture. This is a not a role for the lone wolf seller. You will partner daily with the broader commercial team to close and support strategic opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leading: You will offer thought leadership to clients as well as internally mentor and offer professional insights to junior team members.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a background in B2B client service and have extensive experience consultative sales role where you exceeded business goals on a monthly, quarterly, and/or annual basis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a proven track record in heavy business development initiatives and generating new logos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are comfortable working in a senior role as an individual contributor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You understand what goes into the sales process from prospecting to close, and you’re no stranger to managing multiple complex deals across multiple clients and stages.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are highly organized with a meticulous attention to detail and pattern recognition, you manage your time well and possess expert judgment and decision-making skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a high-impact communicator and know how to present to executive-level stakeholders. You’re no stranger to PowerPoint and the rest of Microsoft Office Suite.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You know your way around Salesforce (or comparable CRM system) and understand the importance of leveraging data to make smart decisions about where to spend your time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You demonstrate a relentless service orientation, effortlessly form trusted-advisor relationships, are catalytic in your desire to improve the status quo, and can operate effectively within a highly collaborative team environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are legally eligible to work in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom’s total rewards philosophy is to be transparent and equitable with all job candidates. The annual base salary range for this role based in New York City, New York is $90,000-$102,500. You will also be eligible to participate in our Quarterly Bonus Plan which on target would be 65% of your base salary for a Manager level role in our Commercial business unit.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Axiom:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom is where legal teams go to find the right talent for everything from routine in-house tasks to complex outside counsel work. Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession. We love the company we’re building with undignified enthusiasm. We’re committed to our mission and to our people. We celebrate our successes, learn from our failures, and find opportunity in adversity. We surround ourselves with inspiring, talented people who have a contagious energy and incurable passion for what they do. We pride ourselves on listening and relating to our colleagues and clients in a way that’s genuine, human, and memorable. We care about the little things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate new, creative, and disruptive ideas to change the status quo in their fields&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess an unbelievable work ethic and unwavering commitment to quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stretch beyond what’s expected and prioritize ongoing learning and development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assume best intentions and take a ‘glass half full’ approach to their work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring others together, creating strong relationships across lines of difference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seek to understand and learn from perspectives counter to their own&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leave a lasting impression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are looking to hire salespeople to fuel our continued growth. With our backing and proven success, we’re looking for evangelists – salespeople who can envision a better future for clients, bring clients to see that vision, and create lasting partnerships that exceed clients’ greatest expectations. This role is well-suited for a highly consultative seller who’s accustomed to sitting at the table with executive-level decision makers to devise solutions to their toughest problems. You will be afforded a high degree of accountability and ownership over a portfolio of F500 and industry leading clients focusing on account growth as well as new business generation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifically, you will spend your days:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Originating opportunity and closing deals: You will be responsible for bringing in new business (new logo generation), originating and selling to our biggest fans, and making believers of fresh clients.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Getting to know your clients: You will define the client experience by building durable relationships, inspiring trust, and proposing innovative solutions to their problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consulting with C-level executives: Our clients are savvy leaders of the world’s largest in-house legal teams, and you will be at the table with them daily planning for their future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborating: At Axiom we pride ourselves on our cross-functional sales culture. This is a not a role for the lone wolf seller. You will partner daily with the broader commercial team to close and support strategic opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leading: You will offer thought leadership to clients as well as internally mentor and offer professional insights to junior team members.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a background in B2B client service and have extensive experience consultative sales role where you exceeded business goals on a monthly, quarterly, and/or annual basis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a proven track record in heavy business development initiatives and generating new logos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are comfortable working in a senior role as an individual contributor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You understand what goes into the sales process from prospecting to close, and you’re no stranger to managing multiple complex deals across multiple clients and stages.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are highly organized with a meticulous attention to detail and pattern recognition, you manage your time well and possess expert judgment and decision-making skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a high-impact communicator and know how to present to executive-level stakeholders. You’re no stranger to PowerPoint and the rest of Microsoft Office Suite.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You know your way around Salesforce (or comparable CRM system) and understand the importance of leveraging data to make smart decisions about where to spend your time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You demonstrate a relentless service orientation, effortlessly form trusted-advisor relationships, are catalytic in your desire to improve the status quo, and can operate effectively within a highly collaborative team environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are legally eligible to work in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom’s total rewards philosophy is to be transparent and equitable with all job candidates. The annual base salary range for this role based in New York City, New York is $90,000-$102,500. You will also be eligible to participate in our Quarterly Bonus Plan which on target would be 65% of your base salary for a Manager level role in our Commercial business unit. You can also participate in our benefits programs that include healthcare, life and disability coverage, 401K with company match, paid sick and personal time off, paid parental leave and more&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Please note that the final compensation is determined by several considerations, including the quality of your experience and expertise, your ability to immediately contribute to Axiom, your potential to move up to the next level, the market you are located in, and other business considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities: &lt;/strong&gt;Upon request and consistent with applicable laws, Axiom will attempt to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities who require an accommodation to participate in the application process.

Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession. We love the company we’re building with undignified enthusiasm. We’re committed to our mission and to our people. We celebrate our successes, learn from our failures, and find opportunity in adversity. We surround ourselves with inspiring, talented people who have a contagious energy and incurable passion for what they do. We pride ourselves on listening and relating to our colleagues and clients in a way that’s genuine, human, and memorable.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Axiom:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom is where legal teams go to find the right talent for everything from routine in-house tasks to complex outside counsel work. Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession. We love the company we’re building with undignified enthusiasm. We’re committed to our mission and to our people. We celebrate our successes, learn from our failures, and find opportunity in adversity. We surround ourselves with inspiring, talented people who have a contagious energy and incurable passion for what they do. We pride ourselves on listening and relating to our colleagues and clients in a way that’s genuine, human, and memorable. We care about the little things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate new, creative, and disruptive ideas to change the status quo in their fields&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess an unbelievable work ethic and unwavering commitment to quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stretch beyond what’s expected and prioritize ongoing learning and development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assume best intentions and take a ‘glass half full’ approach to their work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring others together, creating strong relationships across lines of difference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seek to understand and learn from perspectives counter to their own&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leave a lasting impression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are looking to hire salespeople to fuel our continued growth. With our backing and proven success, we’re looking for evangelists – salespeople who can envision a better future for clients, bring clients to see that vision, and create lasting partnerships that exceed clients’ greatest expectations. This role is well-suited for a highly consultative seller who’s accustomed to sitting at the table with executive-level decision makers to devise solutions to their toughest problems. You will be afforded a high degree of accountability and ownership over a portfolio of F500 and industry leading clients focusing on account growth as well as new business generation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifically, you will spend your days:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Originating opportunity and closing deals: You will be responsible for bringing in new business (new logo generation), originating and selling to our biggest fans, and making believers of fresh clients.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Getting to know your clients: You will define the client experience by building durable relationships, inspiring trust, and proposing innovative solutions to their problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consulting with C-level executives: Our clients are savvy leaders of the world’s largest in-house legal teams, and you will be at the table with them daily planning for their future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborating: At Axiom we pride ourselves on our cross-functional sales culture.

The annual base salary range for this role based in San Francisco, California is $90,000-$102,500. You will also be eligible to participate in our Quarterly Bonus Plan which on target would be 65% of your base salary for a Manager level role in our Commercial business unit. You can also participate in our benefits programs that include healthcare, life and disability coverage, 401K with company match, paid sick and personal time off, paid parental leave and more&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Please note that the final compensation is determined by several considerations, including the quality of your experience and expertise, your ability to immediately contribute to Axiom, your potential to move up to the next level, the market you are located in, and other business considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities: &lt;/strong&gt;Upon request and consistent with applicable laws, Axiom will attempt to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities who require an accommodation to participate in the application process.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Axiom:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom is where legal teams go to find the right talent for everything from routine in-house tasks to complex outside counsel work. Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession. We love the company we’re building with undignified enthusiasm. We’re committed to our mission and to our people. We celebrate our successes, learn from our failures, and find opportunity in adversity. We surround ourselves with inspiring, talented people who have a contagious energy and incurable passion for what they do. We pride ourselves on listening and relating to our colleagues and clients in a way that’s genuine, human, and memorable. We care about the little things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate new, creative, and disruptive ideas to change the status quo in their fields&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Possess an unbelievable work ethic and unwavering commitment to quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stretch beyond what’s expected and prioritize ongoing learning and development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assume best intentions and take a ‘glass half full’ approach to their work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bring others together, creating strong relationships across lines of difference&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seek to understand and learn from perspectives counter to their own&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leave a lasting impression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are looking to hire salespeople to fuel our continued growth. With our backing and proven success, we’re looking for evangelists – salespeople who can envision a better future for clients, bring clients to see that vision, and create lasting partnerships that exceed clients’ greatest expectations. This role is well-suited for a highly consultative seller who’s accustomed to sitting at the table with executive-level decision makers to devise solutions to their toughest problems. You will be afforded a high degree of accountability and ownership over a portfolio of F500 and industry leading clients focusing on account growth as well as new business generation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifically, you will spend your days:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Originating opportunity and closing deals: You will be responsible for bringing in new business (new logo generation), originating and selling to our biggest fans, and making believers of fresh clients.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Getting to know your clients: You will define the client experience by building durable relationships, inspiring trust, and proposing innovative solutions to their problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consulting with C-level executives: Our clients are savvy leaders of the world’s largest in-house legal teams, and you will be at the table with them daily planning for their future.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborating: At Axiom we pride ourselves on our cross-functional sales culture. This is a not a role for the lone wolf seller. You will partner daily with the broader commercial team to close and support strategic opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Leading: You will offer thought leadership to clients as well as internally mentor and offer professional insights to junior team members.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a background in B2B client service and have extensive experience consultative sales role where you exceeded business goals on a monthly, quarterly, and/or annual basis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a proven track record in heavy business development initiatives and generating new logos.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are comfortable working in a senior role as an individual contributor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You understand what goes into the sales process from prospecting to close, and you’re no stranger to managing multiple complex deals across multiple clients and stages.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are highly organized with a meticulous attention to detail and pattern recognition, you manage your time well and possess expert judgment and decision-making skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a high-impact communicator and know how to present to executive-level stakeholders. You’re no stranger to PowerPoint and the rest of Microsoft Office Suite.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You know your way around Salesforce (or comparable CRM system) and understand the importance of leveraging data to make smart decisions about where to spend your time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You demonstrate a relentless service orientation, effortlessly form trusted-advisor relationships, are catalytic in your desire to improve the status quo, and can operate effectively within a highly collaborative team environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are legally eligible to work in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom’s total rewards philosophy is to be transparent and equitable with all job candidates. The annual base salary range for this role based in San Francisco, California is $90,000-$102,500. You will also be eligible to participate in our Quarterly Bonus Plan which on target would be 65% of your base salary for a Manager level role in our Commercial business unit. You can also participate in our benefits programs that include healthcare, life and disability coverage, 401K with company match, paid sick and personal time off, paid parental leave and more&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Please note that the final compensation is determined by several considerations, including the quality of your experience and expertise, your ability to immediately contribute to Axiom, your potential to move up to the next level, the market you are located in, and other business considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities: &lt;/strong&gt;Upon request and consistent with applicable laws, Axiom will attempt to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities who require an accommodation to participate in the application process.

Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession.

To do this, Freenome uses a multiomics platform that combines tumor and non-tumor signals with machine learning to find cancer in its earliest, most-treatable stages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"&gt;Cancer is relentless. This is why Freenome is building the clinical, economic, and operational evidence to drive cancer screening and save lives. Our first screening test is for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"&gt;colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced adenomas, and it’s just the beginning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"&gt;Founded in 2014, Freenome has ~500 employees and more than $1.1B in funding from key investors, such as the American Cancer Society, Andreessen Horowitz, Anthem Blue Cross, Bain Capital, Colorectal Cancer Alliance, DCVC, Fidelity, Google Ventures, Kaiser Permanente, Novartis, Perceptive Advisors, RA Capital, Roche, Sands Capital, T.

A “Freenomer” is a determined, mission-driven, results-oriented employee fueled by the opportunity to change the landscape of cancer and make a positive impact on patients’ lives. Freenomers bring their diverse experience, expertise, and personal perspective to solve problems and push to achieve what’s possible, one breakthrough at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"&gt;Freenome is looking for an experienced infrastructure engineer to help build a cloud-native machine learning platform for the world’s largest multi-analyte cancer genomics dataset.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"&gt;As an engineering-forward biotech company, we apply modern engineering practices to build reliable, maintainable, scalable, and secure production systems for our clinical lab and Computational and Molecular Research Scientists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 300;\"&gt;Our infrastructure team is a small group where you will help set the culture and build the systems that allow us to move fast without breaking things.

    "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Axiom:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Axiom is where legal teams go to find the right talent for everything from routine in-house tasks to complex outside counsel work. Too many legal departments are stuck having to choose between paying the high fees of their law firm, hiring full-time employees they don’t need, or turning to a low-cost agency that can’t meet their quality standards. At the same time, top lawyers want to work on challenging legal matters, but they want more control over how, when, and where they practice. Both are forced compromises that no one should have to make. Axiom shares and meets the higher standards of its clients and lawyers, with our “work smarter, adapt faster, go further” approach – connecting growing mid-market and Fortune 500 companies with the world’s deepest bench of experienced, specialized legal talent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We exist to inject new energy and new thinking into a precedent-bound profession. We love the company we’re building with undignified enthusiasm. We’re committed to our mission and to our people.

Red Canary’s goal is to provide both the general skills (e.g, resume support, interviewing, peer interaction), and specialized skills (e.g., cyber security operations, analysis, engineering) that are required to be successful after separation. We also hope to create a pipeline of job opportunities to expand to our growing Veteran employee base. </span></div><div><br/></div><div><i><b style=\"font-size: 11pt\">To be eligible for participation in the Skillbridge Program, you must be an Active Duty U.S. Military personnel with plans to separate within the next year.</b></i></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b style=\"font-size: 18px\">Program Overview</b></div><div><br/></div><div><b style=\"font-size: 18px\">General Skills &amp; Canary Veteran Mentor</b></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 11pt\">Red Canary believes that training the Skillbridge Candidates on how to GET the job is just as important as how to DO the job.

As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered view of the Internet, cloud and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers work together to identify problems before it impacts revenue, damages brand reputation, or halts employee productivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"&gt;In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco’s Network Services Business Group and is a foundational component of Cisco’s growing Observability business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We're all familiar with the technology, but have you ever wondered how the Internet actually works? At ThousandEyes, we spend every day working to help customers understand the gotchas of Internet-based service delivery: how to identify problems, how to resolve, and how to avoid them in the future. Our Customer Engineering team is tasked with empowering our customers with ThousandEyes to ease their performance monitoring pains.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy variety in job responsibilities, this is the job for you.&amp;nbsp; A day may involve helping a customer identify network loss in an undersea cable, diagnose the cause of a route leak impacting significant portions of internet traffic, scripting an approach to monitoring a website's login flow, spinning up a lab environment to reproduce a strange set of behaviors seen in a customer's environment, saving a company hours of bridge time during a significant outage impacting their infrastructure by finding the smoking-gun in a network outage, or simply helping someone understand the way that our applications work.&amp;nbsp; The job is highly variable and requires both the ability to make data-driven decisions, and draw conclusions based on incomplete information.&amp;nbsp; We're looking for out-of-the-box thinkers who can complement and extend the already formidable talents of our Customer Enablement organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;*** We are looking for candidates who are already based in Mexico or Mexico City***&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Timely interaction with customers and internal teams requesting support via online-chat, email and phone&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take ownership of technical issues, working with cross-functional teams to document problem definition, troubleshooting procedures, and resolution steps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take ownership of customer support forum and keep information current on best practices with ThousandEyes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Active participation in 24x7 Support Coverage model&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify process &amp;amp; workflows ripe for improvement or automation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A standout \"customer first\" attitude&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field, or equivalent working experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At least 3-5 years working in a customer-facing role support in the organization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expert understanding of network and application protocols (Cisco/Juniper certification strongly preferred - CCNA/DEVNET/JNCP,etc. )&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Cloud/SaaS software products is highly desirable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of ISP, CDN, and cloud service provider networks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of web technologies and VoIP applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands on experience with hypervisors such as KVM, VMware, Hyper-V, and VirtualBox&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hands on experience with container administration tools such as docker and kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of at least one computer language and programming framework desirable, JavaScript and Python are a plus&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge in security, authentication, permissions, SSO&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in administering Linux based operating systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in technical writing is a plus&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to prioritize &amp;amp; complete tasks in a timely fashion&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to communicate clearly and concisely to technical and non-technical users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven troubleshooting and problem-solving skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"&gt;Cisco values the perspectives and skills that emerge from employees with diverse backgrounds. That's why Cisco is expanding the boundaries of discovering top talent by not only focusing on candidates with educational degrees and experience but also placing more emphasis on unlocking potential. We believe that everyone has something to offer and that diverse teams are better equipped to solve problems, innovate, and create a positive impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification&lt;/strong&gt;. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification. Research shows that people from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy. We urge you not to prematurely exclude yourself and to apply if you're interested in this work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\"&gt;Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Department&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s engineering teams build and maintain the systems and products that power our global platform. A global platform which is within approximately 50 milliseconds of about 95% of the Internet connected population, serving on average, over 46 million HTTP requests per second.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare engineering delivers code to production at a tremendous pace, and depends on automated testing to do so without incidents. The Testing at Scale team builds and runs tooling for other engineering teams, to allow them to write tests that verify the interactions between systems and products in production at huge scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are we looking for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for highly motivated software engineers to join our Testing at Scale team.&amp;nbsp; You’ll have a strong programming background with a deep understanding and experience developing and maintaining&amp;nbsp; distributed systems.

We measure our success in the carbon reduction achievements of our customers. We are looking for team members who love product-building, want to work hard at a mission-oriented startup, and will collaborate with us in shaping the culture of a growing team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have offices in San Francisco, New York and London and remote team members across the US and Europe. We hope that you'll be interested in joining us!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=\"jsx-3935740654\"&gt;The role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our first dedicated event marketer, you’ll be tasked with designing, producing, and reporting on outstanding experiences that help drive leads, accelerate open opportunities, and elevate and expand our brand. Partnering closely with teams across Watershed––from sales to partnerships, customer success to leadership, and more––you’ll support our revenue goals, brand plays, and go-to-market motions by delivering exceptional events that delight our audiences, meaningfully accelerate demand, and advance the climate conversation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our ideal candidate will be a seasoned, creative, and organized marketer with a proven track record of executing best-in-class experiences, from tentpole brand moments to scalable field events. You’ll be someone who loves rolling up their sleeves to get the job done, and is equally comfortable––and excited––to go venue hunting, outline a project plan, brainstorm roundtable topics, or analyze performance metrics. You don’t need to be a climate expert (yet!), but passion for our mission is a big plus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan, manage, and execute first- and third-party event activations from end-to-end, from strategic concepting to detailed logistics to post-event reporting, and much more&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Help architect and drive Watershed’s event strategy in order to build our brand, generate pipe with enterprise prospects, influence opportunities, and retain customers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with the sales team to identify invitees, track leads, set up meetings during and around events, and design a promotion strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write clear and compelling event communications, including for invites, sales team outreach, and landing pages&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage budgets, resources, and external vendors and agencies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Research events and sponsorship opportunities based on objectives, target audiences, and industries, and make proactive recommendations for adjustments to our strategy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enable the events program to scale by creating and distributing resources such as templates and playbooks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Regularly evaluate event outcomes and successes, share learnings, and optimize and adjust plans based on those learnings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In any given month, the types of projects you’ll work on may include:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Field marketing events, like executive events, webinars, or activations at industry conferences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tentpole brand events, like virtual and in-person Watershed-produced conferences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Event measurement and reporting, including setting targets for key event metrics, tracking &amp;amp; monitoring performance, and sharing pre- and post-event reports&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our ideal candidate will have:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3-5 years of marketing experience, with at least 2+ years of that in B2B event marketing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Superb event management, prioritization, and project management skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven experience successfully owning and executing on a wide range of event types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A data-driven mindset and know-how to set, drive, and regularly report on event performance metrics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of a CRM platform, such as Salesforce&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A collaborative spirit and excellent stakeholder management skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Obsessive attention to detail&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Outstanding writing and communication skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comfort with fast-paced, scrappy environments, with a bias towards being proactive and self-directed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=\"content-conclusion\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your approach to remote work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Watershed is hiring team members on all US and EU time zones, and we’re committed to growing a long-term distributed team. We have hub offices in San Francisco, New York and London, and remote team members from Oregon to New Jersey to Ireland. There may be certain jobs that need to be in San Francisco / New York / London or certain locations, and will be specifically noted in the job description or in conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the interview process like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It starts the same for every candidate: getting to know the team members through 1 to 2 conversations about Watershed, your experience, and your interests. Next steps can vary by role, but usual next steps are a skill or experience screen (e.g. a coding interview for an engineer, a portfolio review for a designer, deeper experience call for other roles) which leads to a virtual or in person interview panel after that if the screens go well. We prioritize transparency and lack of surprise throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
