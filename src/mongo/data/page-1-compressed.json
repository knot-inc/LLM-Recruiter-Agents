My\nreports are priority number 1 for me - sometimes to a fault! You can expect (and\nmay even grow to love) the fun Slack emoji and light hearted banter. I never\nmiss a moment to laugh but also know when it’s time to go heads down and GSD! As\na true team player I genuinely enjoy collaborating with a thought partner,\nproductive discourse, and soaking in frontline feedback from my team. Outside of\nwork, you can find me cooking simple yet delicious meals, spending time with\nfamily, jogging, hiking or taking long walks with my partner, and planning our\nnext trip. Next stop, Hawaii!\n\n\nMark Kent [https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-a-r-kent/] - Customer Support\nLead\nHi, I'm Mark, leading the Patient Experience Team at Rupa!
